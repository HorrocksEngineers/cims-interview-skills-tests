# Database Normalization + TypeORM

[Back](/README.md#cims-interview-skills-tests)

## Background

Databases are integral to any project you're working on. Anyone who's worked with a poorly constructed database knows the absolute frustration involved with querying, managing, and just dealing with it on a daily basis.

CIMS is not immune to this, but we don't want to introduce anymore jank than already exists.

This execise is intended to test both your database normalization skills and ability to set up entities using TypeORM

## Requirements
