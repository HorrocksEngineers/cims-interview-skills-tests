# React + Apollo Client + Ant Design

[Back](/README.md#cims-interview-skills-tests)

## Background

CIMS is a React shop. We're a little behind on the version, and still use Create React App, but that doesn't change the basic need to use React in our UI.

CIMS also strives to use the Ant Design component library to simplify UI workflows and provide a consistent look and feel throughout the app. For the bulk of workflows, if you find yourself writing HTML and CSS by hand... you're probably making our lives harder in the future. This doesn't, however, mean you can't wrap up Ant Design components around custom components or add one-off styles to construct the UI.

When pulling data from the server, we use the Apollo GraphQL Client library to query and mutate the database. We go as far as writing our GraphQL operations in their own `.graphql` files and use another library to generate most of the Apollo Code we actually use.

A fair amount of code has been written for you to get started.

## Requirements

1. Resolve as many TODOs as possible
