# React + Apollo Client + Ant Design

[Back](/README.md#cims-interview-skills-tests)

## Background

CIMS is a React shop. We're a little behind on version, and still use Create React App, but that doesn't change the basic need to use React in our UI

CIMS also strives to use the [Ant Design](https://ant.design/components/overview/) component library to simplify UI workflows and provide a consistent look and feel throughout the app. For the bulk of workflows, if you find yourself writing HTML and CSS by hand... you're probably making our lives harder in the future. That doesn't mean you can't wrap up Ant Design components around custom components in order to construct a UI

When pulling data from the server, we use the [Apollo GraphQL Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) library to query and mutate the database. We go as far as writing our GraphQL operations in their own .graphql files and use another library to generate many of the Apollo Code we actually use. In this execise, you'll be doing things a little more vanilla

## Requirements

- Build a Functional React Component
- Use the Ant Design Component Library
- Query/Mutate data using Apollo Client

TODO use https://codesandbox.io/ to build a basic env in here
