# JavaScript Data Structure Manipulation

[Back](/README.md#cims-interview-skills-tests)

## Background

Underneath every framework, npm package, API route, and database migration, lies the basic data structures of JavaScript and their various uses/methods.

In CIMS we use TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript with some added "syntactic sugar" that makes JS code a lot more clearly defined and maintainable through type safety. For the purposes of this exercise we'll be skipping the sugar, and using plain ol' JavaScript to get straight to the meat and potatoes.

## Requirements

1. In this directory you'll find 4 numbered files
1. In each file is a data structure and/or function, and a TODO
1. Move through the files in numeric order, solving the TODO in each one

## Getting Started

``` bash
node question1.js
```

Run the .js file you're working on using `node`
