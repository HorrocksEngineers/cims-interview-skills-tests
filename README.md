# CIMS Interview Skills Tests <!-- omit in toc -->

The exercises in this [repository][repo] are designed to help our team get a feel for how you write code and solve problems.

You should have already gotten a list of [prerequesites][prereq] to make sure your environment is set up to complete any exercise.

You will need to fork or clone the repository and go over the [Installation][install] instructions. For about 10-15 minutes, you'll be able to check out each exercise, look over resources, and come up with a game plan. After that time, we'll give you about 30 minutes to complete as much of your selected exercise as possible.

We will be "looking over your shoulder" as you prepare and attempt to complete your exercise; expecting to hear your thoughts as you go.
