# CIMS Interview Skills Tests <!-- omit in toc -->

The exercises in this repository are designed to help our team get a feel for how you write code and solve problems.

You should have already gotten a list of prerequesites to make sure your environment is set up to complete any exercise.

You will need to clone this repository, go over getting started instructions, and create a branch to work out of. For about 10-15 minutes, you'll be able to check out each exercise, look over resources, and come up with a game plan. After that time, we'll give you about 30 minutes to complete as much of your selected exercise as possible.

We will be "looking over your shoulder" as you prepare and attempt to complete your selected exercise; expecting to hear your thoughts as you go.

At the end, we'll have you push your branch upstream so we can review it later if necessary.
